🔁 Day 32 & 33 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge
⏱️ Missed a day, but not the mission. Consistency > Perfection.
Life got in the way yesterday — and that’s okay.

Because showing up again today, stronger and more focused, is what real growth looks like. 💪

🔥 Back to Docker: Two Days, Two Powerful Concepts

📦 Day 32 – Dockerfile Optimization
Learned how to make Dockerfiles cleaner, smaller, and faster.

 ✅ Used multi-stage builds
 ✅ Reduced image size from 800MB → 150MB!

🛠 Why it matters?
 Smaller images = faster deployments + less cost + better performance.


🐳 Day 33 – Docker Networking
Docker containers don’t live in silos — they need to talk!
Today was all about learning how they do that:

🔹 bridge, host & none networks
🔹 user-defined bridge networks
🔹 inter-container communication using --link and docker network connect


🌐 I built a 3-tier architecture:
 Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database — all talking through custom bridge networks.

💬 Biggest Realization?
Containers are not just about isolation — they’re about controlled connectivity.

Mastering this means you're not just running apps — you're orchestrating systems. ⚙️

📌 What’s Next: Docker Volumes & Data Persistence

🙌 Tagging my mentor Shubham Londhe and thanking Md. Afzal Hassan Ehsani for always keeping us on track, even when we fall behind.

💭 How do you handle missed days in your learning journey?
Let’s normalize breaks. Let’s celebrate comebacks.
