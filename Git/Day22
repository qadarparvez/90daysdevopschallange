🧠 “Wait... what just happened to my code?”
That one moment of panic — we’ve all been there.
And that’s when I realized...
It’s not just about writing code. It’s about protecting it.


🚀 Day 22 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge
Week 4 begins: Enter Git. My new time-travel machine. 🌀
Today, I started learning Git — and honestly?
I now understand why it’s one of the most powerful tools in DevOps.


🔧 What I did today:

 ✅ Initialized a local Git repo
 ✅ Learned the flow of add → commit → log
 ✅ Understood how Git snapshots changes
 ✅ Ran my first ever rollback (yes, it felt like magic)
 ✅ Finally understood what .git actually stores
📜 Basic but powerful:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "First script tracked!"
git log --oneline

💡 Biggest takeaway:
 👉 If you're working without Git, you're working without a safety net.
 Even for a single .sh file — version control is peace of mind.

💬 I’d love to know:

 What’s the first thing YOU ever put under Git version control?
 Was it a messy project? A config file? Something that broke your system? 😅
