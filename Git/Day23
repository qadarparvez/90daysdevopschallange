🧠 “Everything was fine… until I merged.”
 That was me, today. And that’s why I’m back with Day 23 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge — still deep in Git... and this time, it's personal. 😅


📌 Today’s topic: Git Branching & Merging

One of the most powerful — and terrifying — features for beginners.
But once you understand it, Git goes from scary to superpowerful.


🔍 What I learned today:

 ✅ Creating and switching branches
 ✅ Merging changes safely
 ✅ Avoiding merge conflicts (and surviving them when they happen)
 ✅ Visualizing history with git log --graph
 ✅ Using git stash to avoid losing changes mid-switch


🧪 Commands I practiced:

git checkout -b feature-branch

git merge main

git stash && git stash pop

git log --graph --oneline


💡 Key Takeaway:
 
Branching isn’t just about code. It’s about collaboration.
Git lets multiple people (or future-you) work on features, fixes, and experiments — without breaking what already works.

💬 Let’s make this interactive:
