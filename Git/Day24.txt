💡 "If it's not on GitHub, does it even exist?"
That’s what I used to hear — and honestly, it felt intimidating.
 I thought GitHub was for pros. For big teams. For open-source wizards.
 Not for someone like me, still learning Bash, Shell, and DevOps basics.


🚀 But today, on Day 24 of my hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge… I pushed my first working project to GitHub.
It wasn’t perfect.
It didn’t have stars or forks.
But it was mine — and it was out there.


🧠 What I learned today:
 ✅ How to create a remote GitHub repo
 ✅ Linking it with my local repo using git remote
 ✅ Pushing commits to GitHub
 ✅ Pulling and syncing with git pull
 ✅ The difference between fetch and merge
 ✅ Why GitHub is where collaboration starts


📜 A few commands that changed everything:

git remote add origin https://lnkd.in/gs6Tu7Bg
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main


💭 The biggest mindset shift?
 I’m not just coding anymore. I’m collaborating.
 I’m not just learning Git. I’m building public proof of growth.


📣 If you're still hesitating to post your code on GitHub — start anyway.
 That first push may just be the start of something amazing.

 Do you remember the first time you pushed something to GitHub?
