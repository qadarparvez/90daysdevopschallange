🚨 Git taught me more about teamwork than any leadership book ever did.
💡 Day 25 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge — I didn’t just write code today, I resolved conflict.
 
🔥 One feature branch. One merge conflict. One breakthrough.
Before today, Git was just a version control tool to me.

Now I see it as a collaboration framework — a system that helps developers work together, without stepping on each other’s toes.
But it only works if you understand one thing: Branches are your friends.


🔍 Today’s journey included:

 ✅ Creating a feature branch: git checkout -b feature-login
 ✅ Switching back to main and merging changes
 ✅ Facing my first merge conflict and manually resolving it
 ✅ Using git log and git diff to debug and track progress
 ✅ Visualizing the entire structure with git log --oneline --graph


🧠 Key Realization:

"Merge conflicts don’t mean something’s broken.
 They mean multiple people are trying to build something — together."
🔧 Today’s favorite Git commands:

git branch -a
git merge
git diff
git log --oneline --graph

🗣️ Let’s talk:
 👉 What was your first merge conflict like?
 👉 Do you prefer Git Flow, trunk-based development, or something custom?
