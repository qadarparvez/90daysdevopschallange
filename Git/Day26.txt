💻 One laptop. One push command. One repo now live on GitHub.
🌍 Today, I crossed the line from learning alone… to collaborating globally.
📦 Welcome to Git Remotes & Real DevOps.


Day 26 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge and I finally stepped into the world of real collaboration.

Git is no longer just about saving my work — it’s about syncing with the world, contributing to projects, and working like a true DevOps engineer.


🔁 What I practiced today:
 ✅ Cloned a repository using git clone
 ✅ Added remotes using git remote add
 ✅ Pushed changes to GitHub with git push -u origin main
 ✅ Pulled updates with git pull
 ✅ Understood the difference between origin and upstream
 ✅ Forked, edited, and created pull requests like it’s second nature


💡 Key realization:
“Git is more than commits — it’s communication, contribution, and collaboration.”
🧠 Today’s key commands:

git clone <repo-url>
git remote -v
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main
git remote add upstream <url>
