🚀 Today I didn’t just write code — I launched it into the world.
💡 One git push, and suddenly my local work became globally visible.
🌐 GitHub isn’t just a platform — it’s your proof, your portfolio, your playground.


Day 27 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge, and today I crossed one of the most important milestones in any developer’s journey:

👉 Collaborating with Git & GitHub like the real world works.
Until now, I was working locally.
 
Everything stayed on my machine, private, safe, isolated.
But DevOps isn’t about isolation — it’s about building, breaking, and collaborating openly.


🧠 Here’s what I learned and practiced today:
 
 ✅ Cloning repositories with git clone
 ✅ Adding and inspecting remotes with git remote add and git remote -v
 ✅ Pushing local changes to GitHub using git push -u origin main
 ✅ Pulling updates using git pull
 ✅ Understanding the difference between origin and upstream
 ✅ Practicing GitHub pull requests: Fork > Feature > PR > Review > Merge


🌟 What changed for me today:

For the first time, I saw my code live on GitHub, not just as a file… but as a statement —
 
 📦 “Here’s what I built.”
 🧠 “Here’s how I think.”
 🔁 “Here’s how I collaborate.”
This is where open-source starts.
 This is where team development becomes possible.
 This is where your DevOps foundation gets real.


🔧 Top Git/GitHub commands I practiced:

git clone <repo-url>
git remote -v
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main
git remote add upstream <url>


💡 My favorite learning from today:
“Every push is a contribution.
 Every commit is a learning milestone.
 Every pull request is a conversation.”
Git isn’t just for version control — it’s for career control.
 Because GitHub tells your story long before you enter the interview.
