🔥 “I didn’t just learn Git this week — I became dangerous with it.”
🚀 Day 28 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge
✅ Week 4: Git & GitHub – COMPLETE

4 weeks ago, I typed git init without knowing what I was getting into.
Today, I can confidently push, pull, merge, revert, and even fix conflicts without panic 😎


💻 Here’s what I conquered in Week 4:
 
 🔹 Set up local repos and committed like a pro
 🔹 Created feature branches and merged with confidence
 🔹 Handled real merge conflicts (not fun, but powerful!)
 🔹 Used git log, git diff, and git status like a timeline
 🔹 Collaborated on GitHub — fork, pull request, review, merge
 🔹 Learned the difference between origin and upstream
 🔹 Understood how real teams work with Git Flow and trunk-based development


💡 Biggest takeaway:
“Git isn't just about version control — it’s about professional control.”
 Every commit is proof of progress. Every push is a signal of discipline.


🧠 My favorite commands this week:

git checkout -b feature-branch
git merge main
git remote add upstream <url>
git log --graph --oneline

📸 I’ve been documenting everything on GitHub — and now my profile isn’t just a link…
