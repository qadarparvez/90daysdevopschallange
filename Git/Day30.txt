🚀 Day 30 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge — 1 Month Complete!
🐳 Today, I unlocked one of the most powerful tools in a DevOps engineer’s toolkit: Docker Compose.

From managing a single container to orchestrating multi-service applications — this is where real DevOps starts to feel real. 💡


💭 Just a few weeks ago, I was learning how to run my first container.
 It felt amazing — but also overwhelming.

Today, I can spin up an entire multi-tier application — frontend, backend, and database — all with a single YAML file and one command.

That’s the power of Compose.

🔧 What I Built Today:
 
 ✅ Created a docker-compose.yml for the online_shopping_app
 ✅ Defined services like node-app, mongo, and nginx
 ✅ Linked containers via Docker’s internal networking
 ✅ Used .env variables, bind mounts & volumes
 ✅ Ran docker-compose up -d — and the full app just worked 🤯


📦 Why Docker Compose Changed the Game for Me:

No more juggling 3+ docker run commands
Makes apps portable and production-like
Perfect for simulating real environments
Boosts team collaboration and CI/CD pipelines
Best of all — apps now run consistently across systems!


🧠 Commands I Practiced Today:

docker-compose up -d 
docker-compose ps 
docker-compose logs 
docker-compose down

Also explored .env usage, container dependencies, restart policies, and network isolation.

💡 Biggest Lesson Today?
DevOps isn’t just about commands.
It’s about designing workflows, orchestrating services, and connecting pieces that just work.

🎯 Wrapping up Month 1 with a huge leap:
 From single containers to multi-service orchestration using Docker like a pro.
