🚀 Docker isn’t just a buzzword — today, I proved it with real code.
🐳 I built & deployed a shopping app using Docker — and it worked like magic!
💥 No more “it works on my machine” — now it works everywhere.

🔹 Day 29 of hashtag#90DaysDevOpsChallenge

Welcome to Week 5 — we’re diving into Docker: the core of containerization, portability, and scalable deployments.
Instead of just reading docs or running hello-world, I challenged myself to containerize a real-world Node.js project —

👉 Online Shopping App by Shubham Londhe & Md. Afzal Hassan Ehsani


🧠 What I Learned by Doing:
 
 ✅ Understood Docker’s layered architecture and image building
 ✅ Wrote a custom Dockerfile to containerize the Node.js backend
 ✅ Built an image and tagged it locally
 ✅ Exposed the container to serve the app on custom ports
 ✅ Verified the deployed shopping app running inside a container
 ✅ Learned how logs, volumes, and containers work under the hood


📦 Why this felt different:

Reading about Docker is easy. But running a real app inside a container taught me:
How to think in layers and optimize builds
How to debug container logs when things fail (they did 😅)
Why Docker is a game-changer for DevOps pipelines


🔧 Commands I used today:

docker build -t shopping-app .
docker run -d -p 5173:5173 shopping-app
docker ps
docker logs <container_id>

📍 Next: I’ll be exploring Docker Compose, multi-container setups, and eventually deploying to cloud!

💬 Have you ever Dockerized a real project?

What was your biggest takeaway when you first touched Docker?

 One container at a time — we’re getting closer to DevOps mastery 💪
