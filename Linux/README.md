WEEK 2 : DAY 4 : Linux

Today, I explored web hosting on Linux by creating a simple HTML page using DeepSeek and deploying it on an NGINX server! 🚀

🔹 Created an HTML file with basic content.
🔹 Configured NGINX to serve the page
🔹 Tested the deployment on a web browser

This hands-on experience gave me a deeper understanding of web hosting, NGINX configuration, and static file serving in a Linux environment.

Looking forward to more DevOps learning! 💪
