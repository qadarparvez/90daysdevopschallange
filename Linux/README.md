Linux: Linux is a free, open-source operating system (OS) based on Unix. It acts as an interface between computer hardware and software applications, managing system resources like memory, CPU, and storage.

Features of Linux:
1. Open source
2. Secure
3. Simplified updates for all installed software.
4. Multiuser

File System Hierarchy:
/home: home directory for other users.
/root: It is home directory for root user.
/boot: It contains bootable files for Linux.
/etc: It contains all configuration files.
/usr: By default software are installed in this directory.
/bin: It contains commands used by all users.
/sbin: It contains commands used by the root user.
/opt: Optional application software packages.
/dev: Essential device files.

mv old_name new_name: move or rename a file/directory
find /home -name "file.txt": find files by name

uptime: check system uptime
whoami: check current username
chmod 755 file.sh: change file permissions
chown user:user file.txt: change file ownership


WEEK 2 : DAY 3 : Linux

File Permissions:
r (read) → 4
w (write) → 2
x (execute) → 1

Changing Permissions:

who : Show logged-in users
id : Show user ID and group ID
adduser username : Add a new user
passwd username : Change user password

WEEK 2 : DAY 4 : Linux

Today, I explored web hosting on Linux by creating a simple HTML page using DeepSeek and deploying it on an NGINX server! 🚀

🔹 Created an HTML file with basic content.

🔹 Configured NGINX to serve the page

🔹 Tested the deployment on a web browser

Week 2 of hashtag#90daysdevopschallenge with Shubham Londhe done! 🏆

This week, I dived deep into Linux System Administration & Automation and explored essential concepts that every DevOps engineer must master. Here’s what I accomplished:
✅ Managed users & SSH access 🔐
✅ Set up file permissions & storage volumes 📁
✅ Analyzed logs using AWK, Grep & Sed 📜
✅ Automated backups using shell scripting & cron 🛠️

🔹 Key Learnings:
 - Effective user & group management ensures security.
 - File & directory permissions help in access control.
 - Logs provide crucial insights for troubleshooting.
 - Automation with shell scripts makes system management efficient!
