DAY 1 : Networking Basics

üåê When two or more computers and computing devices Connected together with each other through communication channels, such as cables or wireless media and sharing , then it is a network. 

The Internet is the largest network in the world and can be called "the network of networks".

The OSI model
The OSI (Open System Interconnection) model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network. OSI model was developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation (Iso). The OSI model consists of 7 layers and each layer has specific functions and responsibilities:
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

The TCP/IP model
The TCP/IP model, also known as the Internet Protocol Suite, is a simplified version of the OSI model with only 4 layers instead of 7.

1. Application Layer = (Application Layer + Presentation Layer + Session Layer) 2. Transport Layer
3. Internet Layer
4. Network Access Layer (Data Link Layer + Physical Layer)
 
IP
IP (Internet Protocol) is a set of rules that governs data transfer across networks, assigning unique addresses to devices for communication.

MAC Address
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a device's network interface for local network communication.
 
Router
A router is a networking device that directs data between different networks, enabling communication between devices and the internet.

Switch
A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a local network and directs data to the correct destination using MAC addresses.

Fire Wall
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
